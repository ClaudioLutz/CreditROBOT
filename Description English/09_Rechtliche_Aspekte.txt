### Data Protection Classification of Credit Reports
- Transferring data for credit checks constitutes data transmission to third parties.
- Client (customer) and credit agency are separate controllers under data protection law.
- Not considered data processing on behalf of others, as credit agencies act independently and on their own responsibility.

### Characteristics of Genuine Data Processing on Behalf of Others (in the Data Protection Sense)
- Contractor acts exclusively according to contractually defined instructions from the client.
- Examples:
  - Document destruction
  - Call center services
  - External postal service providers
- Contractor has no independent decision-making or operational discretion.

### No Data Processing on Behalf of Others in Credit Checks
- Credit agencies independently research and are responsible for their own information provision.
- They are independent, responsible entities separate from the requesting company.

### Data Protection Situation in Debt Collection Services
- Debt collection agencies independently decide on measures (reminder letters, telephone reminders, legal actions).
- Transfer of claim data from creditor to debt collection agency is also not considered data processing on behalf of others.
- Debt collection agency is an independent and responsible entity under data protection law.

### Status of the Statement
- July 2023, St. Gallen
- Equally applicable under EU GDPR.

### Summary
- Credit reports and debt collection services are not considered data processing on behalf of others under data protection law, as credit agencies and debt collection companies act independently and on their own responsibility.
