## RiskCUBE

**RiskCUBE** is a Creditreform solution that offers the payment method "purchase on invoice" in online shops only to credit-checked customers with manageable risk. An intelligent rule set identifies and minimizes risks and fraud attempts. Shop operators can thus safely integrate invoice payments, typically resulting in higher conversion rates and increased sales.

> *"With this module, we can now sell on invoice in our webshop. Since then, our sales have increased by 30%." – Markus Roger Jenny, CEO, deinKonzept GmbH, Uznach*

### Need

- "Invoice" is the most popular payment method in Swiss online commerce.
- Not offering this payment method increases the risk of abandoned purchases.
- Without credit checks, there is a potentially high risk of payment defaults.
- RiskCUBE ensures that only customers with sufficient creditworthiness can use invoice payments.

### Background

- Due to the popularity of invoice payments, fraud and payment defaults are problematic.
- RiskCUBE determines whether the invoice option can be offered based on credit checks and other factors.

### Scope of Services

1. **Credit check before displaying payment options**
   - After entering address details during checkout, data is sent to RiskCUBE.
   - RiskCUBE assesses the customer's creditworthiness and behavior.
   - Payment methods are restricted or permitted based on the result.

2. **Individual configuration options**
   - Invoice option only with sufficient creditworthiness.
   - Optionally: no invoice option for suspicious behavior, invalid addresses, or exceeded credit limits.
   - Option to allow invoice payments for medium creditworthiness (yellow) or unknown persons (no match).

3. **Risk management**
   - Approval or blocking rules for specific time windows (e.g., night-time block between 01:00 and 04:30).
   - Definable minimum order values, maximum credit limits, and match tolerances.

### Fraud Detection

- **Suspicious shop behavior**: Invoice payment can be disabled if fraud indicators appear.
- **Invalid postal addresses**: No invoice option if the address is invalid or flagged as fraudulent.
- **Time-based restrictions**: Night-time block (no invoice purchases between 01:00 and 04:30).
- **Known fraudulent addresses**: Blocked and reported by Creditreform.
- **Additional IP fraud analysis**: Recommendation to use supplementary fraud add-ons.

### Control Options (excerpt)

- Match tolerance, minimum order value, individual credit limits, fallback rules, handling of differing billing/delivery addresses, automatic exclusion after payment issues.

### General Implementation Steps

1. Provide information to Creditreform (shop software, expected order volume, planned installation date).
2. Creditreform checks availability of plug-ins or custom integration needs and provides an offer.
3. Contract signing and installation coordination.
