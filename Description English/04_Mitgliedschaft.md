Creditreform offers its members comprehensive services to minimize risks from payment defaults and to secure their long-term economic success. Members receive access to up-to-date credit reports based on data from commercial register entries, debt collection offices, residentsâ€™ registration offices, and additional research. Through a shared online database, more than 12,000 members and customers exchange payment experiences and debt collection cases, enabling early identification of poor payers and the avoidance of financial losses.

Creditreform has seven independent regional offices in Switzerland and is represented across Europe with around 180 branches, with approximately 165,000 companies as members throughout Europe.
