### Data Protection Classification of Credit Reports
- Disclosure of data for credit checks constitutes a transfer of data to third parties.
- Client (customer) and credit agency are legally separate controllers under data protection law.
- No data processing on behalf, as credit agencies act independently and on their own responsibility.

### Characteristics of Genuine Data Processing on Behalf (in the sense of data protection law)
- The processor acts exclusively according to contractually fixed instructions of the controller.
- Examples:
  - Document destruction
  - Call center services
  - External mail delivery service providers
- No own decision-making or scope of action for the processor.

### No Data Processing on Behalf for Credit Inquiries
- Credit agencies conduct research independently and are responsible for their own disclosures.
- They are independent, responsible entities outside the requesting company.

### Data Protection Situation for Debt Collection Services
- Debt collection service providers decide independently on measures (reminder letters, telephone reminders, legal action).
- Transfer of claim data from the creditor to the collection agency is also not considered data processing on behalf.
- The collection agency is an independent and responsible entity under data protection law.

### Status of the Statement
- July 2023, St. Gallen
- Applies equally under the EU GDPR.

### Summary
- Credit reports and debt collection services are not considered data processing on behalf under data protection law, as credit agencies and collection companies act independently and on their own responsibility.

## Automated Decisions Switzerland

1. **High-Risk Profiling**  
   If the score directly leads to a decision with **significant impact** (e.g. credit rejection, contract refusal), this constitutes **high-risk profiling**:
   - It requires **a legal basis, consent, or contractual necessity**.
   - The affected person has the right to:
     - Information about the automated decision,
     - Information about the logic of the scoring,
     - **Request a human review**.

2. **Transparency Obligation**  
   Creditreform must disclose **how the score is calculated** (at least in general terms, e.g. which types of data are included). => https://www.creditreform.ch/ihr-recht/selbstauskunft

3. **Up-to-dateness and Accuracy**  
   The data on which the score is based must be **correct and up to date**. Otherwise, there is **a risk under the Unfair Competition Act (UWG)** or **the Swiss Civil Code (violation of personality rights)**.
