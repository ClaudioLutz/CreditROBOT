# RiskCUBE

**RiskCUBE** is a solution provided by Creditreform that enables online shops to offer the payment method "purchase on invoice" exclusively to credit-checked customers with manageable risk. Through an intelligent set of rules, risks and fraud attempts are identified and minimized. Shop operators can thus safely integrate the "invoice" payment method, which experience shows leads to higher conversion rates and increased sales.

> *"With this module, we can now also sell on invoice in our webshop. Since then, our sales have increased by 30%." – Markus Roger Jenny, Managing Director, deinKonzept GmbH, Uznach*

## Customer Need

- "Invoice" is the most popular payment method in Swiss online commerce.
- If this payment method is not offered, there is an increased risk of abandoned purchases.
- Without credit checks, there is a potentially high risk of payment defaults.
- RiskCUBE ensures that only customers with sufficient creditworthiness can use invoice purchasing.

## Background

- Due to the high popularity of invoice purchasing, fraud and payment defaults are a significant issue.
- RiskCUBE determines, based on credit checks and other factors, whether the invoice option can be offered.

## Scope of Services

1. **Credit Check Before Displaying Payment Options**
   - After entering address details during the ordering process, data is transmitted to RiskCUBE.
   - RiskCUBE assesses the customer's creditworthiness and behavior.
   - Depending on the result, payment methods are either restricted or permitted.

2. **Individual Configuration Options**
   - Invoice option only available with sufficient creditworthiness.
   - Optionally: no invoice option for suspicious behavior, invalid addresses, or exceeded credit limits.
   - Possibility to allow invoice payment even with medium creditworthiness (yellow) or unknown persons (no match).

3. **Risk Management**
   - Approval or blocking rules for specific time windows (e.g., nighttime block between 01:00 and 04:30).
   - Definable minimum order values, maximum credit limits, and match tolerances.

## Fraud Detection

- **Suspicious Shop Behavior**: Invoice payment can be disabled if fraud indicators appear (e.g., multiple orders in a short time, differing delivery addresses, etc.).
- **Invalid Postal Addresses**: No invoice option if the address does not exist or has been previously flagged as suspicious.
- **Time-based Restrictions**: Nighttime block (no invoice purchases between 01:00 and 04:30).
- **Known Fraudulent Addresses**: Blocked and reported by Creditreform.
- **Additional IP Fraud Analysis**: Recommendation to use supplementary fraud add-ons.

## Control Options (Excerpt)

- **Match Tolerance**: Adjustable to allow minor address spelling errors.
- **Minimum Order Value per Transaction**: Invoice purchase only above a certain order value.
- **Individual Credit Limits**:
  - B2B/B2C, per day and/or within a defined period (e.g., 30 days).
  - Different limits depending on credit rating (green/yellow/red) or special customer types (public administration, etc.).
- **Maximum Credit Limit in Case of System Failure**: Fallback rule if RiskCUBE or the interface is unavailable.
- **Different Billing and Delivery Addresses**: Allow or block as desired.
- **Payment Issues**: Automatic exclusion from invoice purchasing if past payment issues occurred.

## General Procedure

1. **Provide Information to Creditreform**
   - Shop software and version
   - Expected number of shop orders per year
   - Planned installation date (plug-in or interface)

2. **Review by Creditreform**
   - Joint clarification with the respective development partner to determine if a plug-in exists for your shop version or if a custom integration is necessary.
   - Preparation of an offer for credit checks.

3. **Contract Conclusion and Installation**
   - After contract signing, a Creditreform project manager coordinates the installation or integration.
   - You receive access credentials, technical documentation, and further details for configuring your risk management.
