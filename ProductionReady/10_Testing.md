# Technical Guide: Testing Strategies

Comprehensive testing is vital for ensuring the reliability, correctness, and maintainability of your application. This guide discusses different types of testing applicable to the CreditRobot project, how to structure tests, and provides a basic example using `pytest` for a Flask route.

## 1. Types of Tests

### 1.1. Unit Tests
*   **Focus:** Test individual components (functions, classes, modules) in isolation.
*   **Goal:** Verify that each unit of code works as expected.
*   **Characteristics:** Fast, mock external dependencies (like databases or external APIs).
*   **Example:** Testing a specific function in `app.py` that performs a calculation, or testing a model's method in `models.py`.

### 1.2. Integration Tests
*   **Focus:** Test the interaction between multiple components or services.
*   **Goal:** Verify that different parts of the system work together correctly.
*   **Characteristics:** Slower than unit tests, may involve real external services (like a test database instance) or carefully controlled mocks.
*   **Example:** Testing if a Flask route correctly interacts with the SQLAlchemy database to retrieve or store data. Testing if `app.py` correctly uses functions from `chatbot_logic.py`.

### 1.3. End-to-End (E2E) Tests
*   **Focus:** Test the entire application flow from the user's perspective.
*   **Goal:** Verify that the complete system behaves as expected in a production-like environment.
*   **Characteristics:** Slowest type of test, often involves UI interaction (if applicable) or full API request-response cycles. Uses real infrastructure or close replicas.
*   **Example:** Simulating a user accessing a web page, submitting a form, and verifying the response and database changes through the UI or API. For CreditRobot, this might involve sending a message to an API endpoint and checking the chatbot's response and any state changes.

## 2. Structuring Tests

It's common practice to place tests in a dedicated `tests/` directory in the root of your project.

├── tests/ # <--- Your tests directory
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── conftest.py        # Pytest fixtures and global config
│   ├── test_unit/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   └── test_example_unit.py
│   ├── test_integration/
│   │   ├── __init__.py

│   └── test_e2e/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       └── test_example_e2e.py
├── Dockerfile
└── README.md
```

*   **`tests/__init__.py`**: Makes `tests` a Python package.
*   **`tests/conftest.py`**: A special `pytest` file for defining fixtures (reusable setup/teardown code for tests), hooks, and plugins that are available globally to all tests.
*   **Subdirectories (`test_unit/`, `test_integration/`, `test_e2e/`)**: Help organize tests by type. Each subdirectory should also contain an `__init__.py`.
*   Test files should typically be named `test_*.py` or `*_test.py` for `pytest` to discover them automatically.

## 3. Testing Tools for Python/Flask

*   **`pytest`**: A popular, powerful, and flexible testing framework. Recommended for this project.
    *   Less boilerplate than `unittest`.
    *   Rich plugin ecosystem.
    *   Easy to write fixtures.
*   **`unittest`**: Python's built-in testing framework.
*   **Flask Test Client**: Flask provides a test client (`app.test_client()`) that allows you to send HTTP requests to your application without running a live server. This is invaluable for route and integration testing.
*   **`pytest-flask`**: A `pytest` plugin with helpful fixtures for testing Flask applications.
*   **`pytest-cov`**: For measuring code coverage.
*   **`mock` (or `unittest.mock`)**: For creating mock objects to isolate units during testing.
*   **`Faker`**: For generating fake data for tests.
*   **`Selenium` / `Playwright`**: For E2E tests involving browser interaction.

## 4. Example: Unit Testing a Flask Route with `pytest`

Let's write a simple unit test for the `/health` endpoint created in Guide `07_Health_Checks.md`.

### 4.1. Install `pytest` and `pytest-flask`
Add them to your `requirements.txt` (or a `requirements-dev.txt`):
```
# requirements.txt or requirements-dev.txt
pytest>=7.0
pytest-flask>=1.2
```
Then install: `pip install pytest pytest-flask`

### 4.2. Create a Test File

Create `tests/test_integration/test_app_routes.py` (this is more of an integration test as it involves the Flask app context, but simple enough for an example here):

```python
# tests/test_integration/test_app_routes.py
import pytest
from app import app as flask_app # Import your Flask app instance

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    """Create and configure a new app instance for each test."""
    # You might want to use a specific test configuration here
    # flask_app.config.update({
    #     "TESTING": True,
    #     # "SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI": "sqlite:///:memory:", # Use in-memory DB for tests
    # })
    yield flask_app

@pytest.fixture
def client(app):
    """A test client for the app."""
    return app.test_client()

def test_health_check(client):
    """Test the /health endpoint."""
    response = client.get('/health')
    assert response.status_code == 200
    json_data = response.get_json()
    assert json_data['status'] == 'ok'
    assert json_data['message'] == 'Application is healthy'

# Example for a non-existent route (optional)
# def test_404_not_found(client):
#     response = client.get('/non-existent-route')
#     assert response.status_code == 404
```

**Explanation:**
*   **`@pytest.fixture def app()`**: This fixture provides your Flask application instance. It's good practice to configure it for testing (e.g., `TESTING=True`, use an in-memory SQLite database for tests involving the DB).
*   **`@pytest.fixture def client(app)`**: This fixture uses the `app` fixture to create a Flask test client.
*   **`test_health_check(client)`**: This is the test function.
    *   It takes the `client` fixture as an argument.
    *   `client.get('/health')` sends a GET request to the `/health` endpoint.
    *   `assert response.status_code == 200` checks if the HTTP status is OK.
    *   `response.get_json()` parses the JSON response.
    *   Assertions then check the content of the JSON response.

### 4.3. Running Tests

1.  Navigate to the root directory of your project in the terminal.
2.  Run `pytest`:
    ```bash
    pytest
    # Or for more verbose output:
    # pytest -v
    # To run tests in a specific file:
    # pytest tests/test_integration/test_app_routes.py
    ```
    `pytest` will automatically discover test files and functions (named `test_*` or `*_test.py`) and run them.

## 5. Testing in CI/CD Pipeline

As shown in Guide `08_CI_CD_Pipeline.md`, you should integrate your tests into your CI/CD pipeline. The workflow should fail if any tests do not pass.

Example snippet from `.github/workflows/ci-cd-pipeline.yml`:
```yaml
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          # ...
          pip install pytest pytest-flask pytest-cov # Install test dependencies
          # ...

      - name: Run tests with Pytest
        run: |
          pytest --cov=app --cov-report=xml # Run tests and generate coverage report
        # Replace 'app' with the name of your main application package/module if different
```

## 6. Further Considerations

*   **Test Coverage:** Aim for high test coverage to ensure most of your code is tested. Use tools like `pytest-cov` to measure coverage. `coverage.py` is another excellent tool.
*   **Mocking Dependencies:** For unit tests, use `unittest.mock` or `pytest-mock` to mock external dependencies (database, APIs, file system) so you can test components in isolation.
*   **Database Testing:**
    *   For integration tests involving the database, use a separate test database.
    *   An in-memory SQLite database (`sqlite:///:memory:`) is fast for testing.
    *   Ensure your database schema is created (e.g., `db.create_all()` in a fixture or use migrations).
    *   Clean up the database between tests or test runs to ensure test isolation.
*   **Testing Chatbot Logic (`chatbot_logic.py`):**
    *   These would likely be unit tests, mocking any external calls the chatbot might make.
    *   Example: `test_get_bot_response()` function, providing various inputs and asserting the expected outputs.

## Conclusion

Implementing a comprehensive testing strategy is a significant investment but pays off in terms of application quality, stability, and ease of maintenance. Start with critical unit and integration tests, and gradually expand your test suite. `pytest` provides a powerful and developer-friendly framework for achieving this in your Flask project.
