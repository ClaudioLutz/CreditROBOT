# Steps to Make This Project Production-Ready with Docker

This document outlines the necessary steps to prepare this project for a production environment using Docker. The steps are ordered by severity and importance.

## 1. (Severity: Critical) Create a Dockerfile
A `Dockerfile` is essential for building a Docker image of the application.
- **Base Image:** Choose an appropriate Python base image (e.g., `python:3.12-slim`).
- **Working Directory:** Set a working directory within the image (e.g., `/app`).
- **Copy Application:** Copy the application code into the image.
- **Install Dependencies:** Copy `requirements.txt` and install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Ensure that `requirements.txt` lists all necessary packages, including a production web server.
- **Expose Port:** Expose the port the application will run on (e.g., `EXPOSE 5000`).
- **Application Runner:** Specify the command to run the application using a production server (e.g., `CMD ["gunicorn", "-b", "0.0.0.0:5000", "app:app"]`).

## 2. (Severity: Critical) Use a Production-Grade Web Server
The Flask development server is not suitable for production.
- **Integrate Gunicorn/uWSGI:** Add Gunicorn or uWSGI to `requirements.txt`.
- **Configuration:** Configure the chosen web server for an appropriate number of workers, timeouts, etc. This configuration can be part of the `CMD` in the Dockerfile or a separate configuration file.

## 3. (Severity: High) Database Management
The current SQLite database (`instance/creditrobot.db`) needs careful consideration for production.
- **Option A (Volume Mounting - for simpler SQLite setups):**
    - Mount a Docker volume to persist the SQLite database file outside the container. This ensures data isn't lost when the container stops or is removed.
    - Example: `docker run -v /path/on/host/db:/app/instance ...`
- **Option B (Dedicated Database Container - for PostgreSQL/MySQL):**
    - Use a separate Docker container for a database like PostgreSQL or MySQL.
    - Update the application to connect to this database (connection strings via environment variables).
    - Use Docker Compose to manage multi-container applications.
- **Option C (Dedicated Database Container - for MS SQL Server):**
    - Use a separate Docker container for Microsoft SQL Server.
    - Update the application to connect, including installing necessary ODBC drivers and configuring connection strings via environment variables.
    - Use Docker Compose to manage multi-container applications. See `03b_Database_Management_MSSQL.md` for a detailed guide.
- **Option D (Managed Database Service):**
    - Use a cloud-provider's managed database service (e.g., AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Azure SQL Database).
    - Configure the application to connect to the managed database (connection strings via environment variables).
- **Backups:** Implement a regular backup strategy for the production database.

## 4. (Severity: High) Configuration Management
Securely manage application configurations rather than hardcoding them.
- **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables for sensitive information like database URLs, secret keys, API keys, etc.
    - Load these in `app.py` (e.g., using `os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')`).
    - Pass them to the Docker container at runtime (e.g., `docker run -e SECRET_KEY='your-secret' ...`).
- **Configuration Files (for non-sensitive config):** For more complex, non-sensitive configurations, consider using a configuration file that can be mounted into the container or baked into the image if it doesn't contain secrets.

## 5. (Severity: Medium) Static File Serving
Serving static files directly from Flask/Gunicorn in production is inefficient for high traffic.
- **Reverse Proxy (Nginx):** Set up Nginx as a reverse proxy in a separate container or on the host.
    - Nginx can serve static files directly (e.g., from a shared volume).
    - Nginx can also handle SSL termination, load balancing, and caching.
- **Whitenoise (simpler alternative):** For less complex applications, Whitenoise can be a simpler solution to serve static files efficiently from within the Python application, though Nginx is generally preferred for larger setups.

## 6. (Severity: Medium) Logging
Implement comprehensive and structured logging.
- **Standard Output:** Configure the application and web server to log to `stdout` and `stderr`. Docker logging drivers can then collect these logs.
- **Log Level:** Make the log level configurable (e.g., via an environment variable).
- **Structured Logging:** Consider using libraries like `python-json-logger` for structured (JSON) logs, which are easier to parse and analyze with log management systems.
- **Log Management System:** For production, forward Docker logs to a centralized logging system (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk, Datadog).

## 7. (Severity: Medium) Health Checks
Implement health check endpoints.
- **Purpose:** Allow orchestration systems (like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm) or load balancers to check if the application is running and healthy.
- **Implementation:** Create a simple endpoint (e.g., `/health`) in the application that returns a `200 OK` status if the application is healthy.
- **Dockerfile:** Use the `HEALTHCHECK` instruction in the Dockerfile to automate health checks.

## 8. (Severity: Low) CI/CD Pipeline
Automate the build, testing, and deployment process.
- **Source Control:** Use Git and a platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
- **Automated Builds:** Set up a CI service (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI) to automatically build the Docker image on every push to the main branch or when a tag is created.
- **Automated Testing:** Integrate automated tests (unit, integration) into the CI pipeline. The build should fail if tests do not pass.
- **Automated Deployment (CD):** Extend the CI pipeline to automatically deploy the new image to staging and production environments after successful tests and approvals.

## 9. (Severity: Low) Security Hardening
Implement general security best practices.
- **Minimize Image Footprint:** Use a slim base image and only install necessary packages to reduce the attack surface.
- **Non-Root User:** Run the application inside the container as a non-root user. Add `USER your_user` to the Dockerfile.
- **Regular Updates:** Regularly update the base image and Python dependencies to patch vulnerabilities. Use tools like `pip-audit` or Snyk to scan for vulnerabilities.
- **Secret Management:** Use a proper secrets management tool (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) for very sensitive data, especially if not using environment variables passed by an orchestrator.
- **Input Validation:** Ensure robust input validation in the application to prevent common web vulnerabilities (XSS, SQLi, etc.).

## 10. (Severity: Low) Testing
Ensure thorough testing in an environment that closely mirrors production.
- **Unit Tests:** Verify individual components/functions.
- **Integration Tests:** Test the interaction between different parts of your application, including the database.
- **End-to-End Tests:** Simulate user scenarios from start to finish.
- **Staging Environment:** Maintain a staging environment that is as close to production as possible for final testing before deployment.
